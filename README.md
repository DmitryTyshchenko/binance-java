## Unofficial Java Binance API Implementation ##

This library is an unofficial lightweight Java Client of [Binance API] (https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md#general-api-information). Requires at least Java 14. Based on Java Http Client and, for now, supports only synchronous calls to Binance.
